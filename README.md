# Enhancer X

Predicting enhancers is challenging due to several factors: they are located in vast non-coding regions of the genome, lack consistent sequence motifs, and their activity varies across different cell types, developmental stages, and environmental conditions. Additionally, enhancers often exhibit redundancy and can function modularly, further complicating their identification. Accurate prediction of enhancers is crucial because they are involved in many biological processes and diseases. 

Our goal with Enhancer X is to predict enhancers using different genomic annotations. By combining various data sources and using advanced computational methods, Enhancer X aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of enhancer prediction. This, in turn, will enhance our understanding of gene regulation and its implications for health and disease. Specifically, we developed two models: one for predicting enhancers based on interactions and another for predicting enhancers from regions. 

This GitHub repository contains all the code used for creating the region model, including data preprocessing, various model constructions and data visualizations. Since we are dealing with big data, therefore we do not upload it directly to the GitHub repo. The data can be accessed through link:
